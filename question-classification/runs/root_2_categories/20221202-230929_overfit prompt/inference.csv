Given the parameters we have available to us, as well as the fact that this function does not return anything, I'm a little lost on what to do.

Any tips on how to approach this function?","I would recommend starting out by reading what the function needs to do, and just writing pseudocode.How do you decide who sings?

10,"A2 Q2 remove() function. Hi instructors,

I was running a few test cases on Q2 and I came across a confusing output.

This is not the original list, and my code modifies the values for each index (a and c which you will see in a bit):

['kevin', 'george', 'kevin'], this is grid[0] of the nested list (grid).

My code already removed an element from this list, therefore this is not the original first element in the nested list. However as you can see, the last 'kevin' should be removed as the next step.

This is the case in my code:

grid[a].remove(grid[a][c])

While running through Python Visualizer, the value of a is still 0 and the value of c become 2. So this line should be

grid[0].remove(grid[0][2]), removing the 3rd element from the very first list in the nested list.

However, although the value of the variables (a, c) are correct, my code removes the first 'kevin'.

It removed grid[0][0], the first element. I'm not sure why this is the case... is it because they are identical elements? Therefore removing the first occurrence? I'm not sure why my code removes grid[0][0], when it was specifically ordered to remove grid[0][2].

I've tried a few other test cases with similar cases and they worked fine. In fact if the list was:

['kevin', 'george', 'keven'], it outputs correctly, removing the last element.

I'm not sure why my code removes the first occurrence if they are both equal even though I specifically assigned to remove the element with a specific index. I'm unable to crack this one. Any help would be great, thank you.","Your hypothesis is correct :)

You might want to use pop here instead of remove.",other, other
