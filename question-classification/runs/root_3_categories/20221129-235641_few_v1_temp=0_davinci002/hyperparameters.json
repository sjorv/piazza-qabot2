Also my group and I are somewhat confused as to how much is expected here since it is worth 20 marks and we can't think of a great deal to write about here.\nClassification: unanswerable\n\nQuestion: A2 Release Date?\nAccording to the syllabus, A2 is due the friday after we come back from reading week...Will A2 be released today?

Can we assume that each value in y is between 0 and 1?\u00a0\nClassification: answerable with the right context\n\nQuestion: Cant seem to make solve_via_sgd work? need help\nClassification: answerable with the right context\n \nQuestion: I wonder if gradient descent is only used to find the optimal coefficients right? We cannot use it to find the optimal hyper-paramater? Thank you!\nClassification: answerable\n\nQuestion: I looked the post on piazza and relooked at lab 2. When we split data into training, validation, test sets, we want different categories(or different pattern) into different sets. We don't want it split randomly.
