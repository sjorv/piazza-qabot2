Question: Unsure of compute_accuracy
Hi, I couldn't complete the Lab 1 on time and submitted what I could so I'm going back and finishing it for my own understanding.

I noticed the TA said I had coded this wrong,
So assumed we would use X_valid and t_valid instead of X_new/t_new but I keep getting this error.
I'm curious where I am going wrong.
Nvm just solved it.

Question:Question about Justification of Results
Justification of Results mentions: "A justification that your implemented method performed reasonably, given the difficulty of the problem—or a hypothesis for why it doesn’t."

Also my group and I are somewhat confused as to how much is expected here since it is worth 20 marks and we can't think of a great deal to write about here.
