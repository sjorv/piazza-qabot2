************** confident vs. not-confident -- 0 shot  **************

Task Description: Classify the below question from an undergraduate course discussion board as either confident or not-confident depending on whether you feel confident
of your answer to the question.

Task Description: First, answer the below question. Then, classify the below question depending on whether you feel confident of your answer to the question. 

Task Description: Classify the below question from an undergraduate course discussion board as either confident or not-confident depending on whether you feel confident
of your answer to the question. If you feel uncertain of your answer, classify it as not-confident.


Question:{0}

Classification:


   - maybe reveals latent structure of questions
   - confident should correspond to knowledge encoded in parameters
   - try to answer assignment based q's i.e. q's w/ context
   - should feel confident answering questions whose knowledge are encoded in parameters. not confident answering assignment related Q's or time-based (perhaps)
   - ** presupposes we know gpt's answer to the question and what is encoded in its parameters. Maybe gpt actually doesn't have the knowledge to answer a self-contained question. **


   - could do <question, gpt-answer, label> where label=0|1 corresponds to not-confident|confident 
    - a self-contained question may be not confident if gpt doesn't know the answer to it
    - self-contained = no reference to course docs
    - conditional on <question,gpt-answer> is gpt confident about its answer?

    - maybe the model feels confident providing a bad answer to a question
    - have it rate the quality of its own question
    - in-context examples help show what you're talking about


    - tell gpt to classify a Q as answerable vs. unanswerable -- how does gpt define what these terms mean? what is an answerable vs. unanswerable q to gpt?
